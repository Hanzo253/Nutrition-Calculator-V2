# Nutrition-Calculator-V2
Another version of my Nutrition Calculator with a different API

Project Specifications:

- Used CalorieNinjas API for nutrition data of food
- Nutrition Calculator V2 app searches for nutrition facts of common food
- Users can enter the food name and quantity of food consumed, and the app will display the nutrients per serving and total overall amount based on the quantity
- This app was made to calculate the amount of nutrition for common foods where the first version can only calculate for brand foods

## If I had more time I would change this

- Find an API that can get the nutrition data of any food
- Add integration testing, unit testing, and end-to-end testing
