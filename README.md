# Nutrition-Calculator-V2
Another version of my Nutrition Calculator with a different API

Project Specifications:

- Used CalorieNinjas API for nutrition data of food
- Nutrition Calculator V2 app searches for nutrition facts of common food
- Users can enter the food name and quantity of food consumed, and the app will display the nutrients per serving and total overall amount based on the quantity
- This app was made to calculate the amount of nutrition for common foods where the first version can only calculate for brand foods

## How I worked on this project

- I worked with tasks on a ClickUp board: [Screenshot of tasks](https://lensdump.com/a/giyZa)
- I used Visual Studio Code as my IDE
- Developed this app with mainly HTML, CSS/SCSS, and JavaScript
- Used jQuery for AJAX to fetch data from the CalorieNinjas API: [CalorieNinjas API website](https://calorieninjas.com/)
- Used a little bit of bootstrap icons: [Bootstrap icons](https://icons.getbootstrap.com/)

## Why I built the project this way

- I wanted to improve on fetching data from API, so I felt like this project helped me learn how to use APIs better.
- I did mostly HTML, CSS/SCSS, and vanilla JavaScript because I am focusing on becoming a developer with them
- I used the CalorieNinjas API because it had nutrition facts for common food
- I developed this app to let users and myself be able to search for the nutrition facts of various food

## If I had more time I would change this

- Find an API that can get the nutrition data of both common and branded food
- Add integration testing, unit testing, and end-to-end testing
